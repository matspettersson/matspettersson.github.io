# Hello and welcome to my blog!

This blog was created using the instructions in the blog post from [fast.ai: Your own hosted blog, the easy, free, open way (even if you're not a computer expert)](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/).

I work as an Enterprise Architect in my daily work, and I've been a developer since the early 1980s. So I don't write code on a daily basis, but I believe that it's important to know at least some level of detail in order to create good solutions as an architect.

My intention is to use this blog as a tool for learning new things. I hope it may be of some interest for you too.
